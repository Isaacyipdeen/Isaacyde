            <h1>
              Effects of 42 Hr of Total Sleep Deprivation on Component Processes of Verbal Working Memory
            </h1>

            <body>
              Maintenance of information in an activated state over brief periods of time (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968).
              Not a one-dimensional construct. Baddeley's multicomponent model of working memory:
              <br>1) Central Executive:
              <br>-Direct attention to relevant information; suppresses irrelevant information
              <br>-Coordination of the slave systems
              <p>
              2) Phonological Loop:
              <br>-Consists of the articulatory loop and the acoustic store (or phonological store)
              <br>-Acoustic store with auditory memory traces that are subject to rapid decay
              <br>-Articulatory loop can revive the memory traces
              <p>
              3) Visuo-spatial sketchpad. Processes visual and spatial information
              <p>
              4) Episodic Buffer
              <br>-Acts as a buffer store between components of working memory, perception and long-term memory.
              <br>-Allows individuals to imagine new concepts
              <br>-Maintains a sense of time
              <hr>
              <h1>Past Studies</h1>
              Global measure of working memory:
              <br>Cannot be further specified in terms of the component processes that are affected
              <br>Cannot develop focused compensation strategies, or understand more about the underlying neurological systems
              <p>
              Tons of studies have showed that WM performance declines following 20 or more hrs of TSD. But several studies failed to prove such a correlation
              Why? A specific component process of WM may already be impacted but cannot be detected in a global score.
              E,g, Sustained attention is the cognitive process most consistently impaired by SD. But it is possible that other component processes of WM compensated for such deficits. Or if task did not require much attention.
              <hr>
              <h1>This Study</h1>
              Aims to find out how 42 hr of TSD will affect the component processes with regards to maintaining information in the WM in young healthy adults.
              <br>To do this, they came up with a computer-based WM test to measure 3 component processes of WM: attention, WM span, and efficiency of encoding into episodic memory
              <h1>Hypothesis</h1>: All 3 components will not be equally affected; attention will be most affected, encoding least affected. Individual differences exist.
